<h2>Welcome to SAT Live!</h2>
<p>
If you are a newcomer to the SATisfiability problem, you might want to take a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem">wikipedia's page on the
 boolean satisfiability problem</a> first. You might also find those <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~tw/sat/">surveys</a> of interest. For a deeper insight of the current int
erest on SAT solvers for software and hardware verification, <a href="http://fmv.jku.at/fs2/">Armin Biere's course on formal systems</a> is a good start. Eugene Goldberg has also 
a nice and somehow non standard way of introducing modern SAT solvers in <a href="http://eigold.tripod.com/papers.html">his three part course on SAT</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Looking for a SAT solver to play with? the following open source SAT solvers might be a good start: <a href="http://www.minisat.se">Minisat (C++)</a>, <a href="http://fmv.jku.at/p
icosat/">Picosat (C)</a>, <a href="http://www.sat4j.org/">SAT4J (Java)</a>.
</p>
<p>You can take a look at <a href="http://www.satlive.org/satnews.jsp">all the current links</a>,
see <a href="http://www.satlive.org/satkwd.jsp">the links classified by keywords</a> or add your own
reference (you must be subscribed to SAT Live! or propose it as anonymous).</p>

<p>If you don't have some links to propose for now but would like email notification of new
additions to the repository, you can subscribe to the <a href="subscribe.jsp">SAT Live!

<p>Finally, a page with some <a href="people.jsp">people interested by the SATisfaction
problem</a> is also available.</p>
